# Pottery of Kutch Static Website

This is a static HTML/CSS/JavaScript version of the Pottery of Kutch website that can be run directly in your browser without any server-side requirements.

## How to Run the Website

1. Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser by double-clicking it or right-clicking and selecting "Open with" your preferred browser.

2. That's it! The website is completely client-side and uses browser localStorage to save cart information.

## Adding Images

Before running the website, you'll need to add some images for the products. The website is looking for these image files:

- `images/product_1.jpg` - Traditional Water Pot
- `images/product_2.jpg` - Khavda Decorative Vase
- `images/product_3.jpg` - Kutch Coffee Mug Set
- `images/product_4.jpg` - Terracotta Dinner Plates

- `images/product_6.jpg` - Serving Bowl with Lid
- `images/hero-bg.jpg` - Hero background image
- `images/about-image.jpg` - About page image

You can add any images you like with these filenames to the `images` folder. If you don't have specific pottery images, you can use any placeholder images and rename them to match these filenames.
